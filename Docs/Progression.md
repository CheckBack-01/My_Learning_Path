## Update Checklist (when you close items)
1. Change status: `☐` → `◐` → `✔`.  
2. Increment counters at the top.  
3. Add links:
   - **Labs:** `labs/<Phase>/<Block>/<pbrXX>/`
   - **Evidence:** `evidence/<Phase>/<Block>/<pbrXX>/`
   - **PAD:** `docs/PAD/<Phase>/<Block>.md`
4. Commit with a clear message:

## Notes
- **PAD = Practical Aptitude Drill:** a **block-integrated mission** that exercises several techniques and evaluates mastery, backed by reproducible evidence.  
- All work is **lab-only**, benign artifacts, and OPSEC/Legal controlled.
