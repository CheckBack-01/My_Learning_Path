# Try Of Check Dogs (TOCD) — My Learning Path

**Objective:** Become a **Reverse Engineer** and **Malware Developer** specialized in **defense evasion**, able to build, modify, conceal, and bypass controls(firewalls, EDR, and other security layers) 
across **Windows** and **Linux**.

**What is TOCD?**  
_Try Of Check Dogs_ is my self-directed learning path, designed to run before, during, and after my studies at [TEP PCMM — PUCMM](https://tep.pucmm.edu.do/ts-ciberseguridad), with the goal of entering the [Johns Hopkins University M.S. track in Reverse Engineering & Vulnerability Analysis](https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/695744-reverse-engineering-and-vulnerability-analysis/).

**Purpose of the path**
1. **Build a solid technical profile** to stand out in offensive security and the job market.  
2. **Earn key certifications** that validate skills and increase visibility, helping fund advanced study at JHU.  
3. **Practice and compete in Bug Bounty**, aiming for real, measurable rewards.

## My Methodology: **Deep-Dive & Layered**

Cybersecurity—especially reverse engineering—demands more than collecting facts. Knowledge must be **absorbed deeply, logically, and stepwise**.  
**Deep-Dive & Layered** structures learning so each layer rests on firm, verifiable foundations.

## TOCD Structure

**Phase → Block → Stack → Mastery Evaluation**

1. **Phase:** Highest level; a macro objective and step-change in competence.  
   Examples:
   - **Phase 1:** Strong fundamentals (hardware, OS, low-level programming).  
   - **Phase 2:** Initial practical application (basic malware analysis, reversing).  
   - **Phase 3:** Advanced mastery (complex malware, exploit dev, high-end evasion).

2. **Block:** A focused theme within a Phase (e.g., “Computer Architecture & Assembly,” “OS Internals”).

3. **Stack:** The smallest unit—sequenced topics/tools that complete a Block.

4. **Mastery Evaluation:** A practical test proving real-world applicability. May include:
   - Solving **CrackMes**  
   - Development/scripting projects  
   - Reversing and evasion exercises

## Practice Types in TOCD

- **CTF (Capture The Flag):** Guided exercises to build theoretical and hands-on foundations.  
- **PBR (Proof-of-Bounty-Readiness):** Reproducible, challenge-driven labs aligned with real-world Bug Bounty scenarios; preparation and execution are fully documented.  
- **PAD (Practical Aptitude Drill):** An **integrated, multi-technique mission per Block** that validates competence under realistic constraints; it **closes the Block** and is evaluative by design.

## Scope & Ethics

* **Lab-only.** All experiments run on my own VMs and benign artifacts.
* **Safety first.** No testing on real systems or third-party infrastructure without explicit authorization.
* **Measurement over claims.** Evasion and “bypass” are framed as **measurable experiments** to understand and improve defenses, not to facilitate misuse.

## Outcome

This is **not** a traditional course. It’s a comprehensive, staged plan that blends theory, labs, simulations, 
and real-world style challenges to produce tangible results: **solid skills**, a **verifiable public portfolio**, and the ability to operate responsibly and effectively in offensive-security lab environments.
